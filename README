In the field of fruit quality assessment, determining the maturity stage of fruits is of great significance. The accurate classification of fruit maturity plays a vital role in the agricultural and food industry, facilitating efficient harvesting, storage, and distribution processes. various processes, such as harvesting, sorting, and post-harvest management in the Agriculture Industry.In this project, we propose a Fruit Maturity Classifier based on deep learning techniques. The classifier aims to automatically classify fruits into three categories: unripe, ripe, and overripe, based on their visual characteristics.Furthermore, To facilitate seamless interaction and interpretation of results, we develop an intuitive front-end interface. This interface allows users to easily upload fruit images, select the desired fruit and model, and obtain instant predictions regarding the fruit's maturity stage. The proposed fruit maturity classification system harnesses the power of deep learning and transfer learning to provide an efficient and accurate solution for fruit maturity assessment. The integration of a user-friendly front-end interface enhances usability and accessibility, making it a valuable tool for farmers, distributors, and consumersThrough this project, the aim is to contribute to the development of advanced technologies that can automate and streamline fruit maturity classification processes, ultimately benefiting fruit producers, distributors, and consumers alike
Our project aims to create a Fruit Maturity Identification System using deep learning  methods. The main objective is to accurately categorize fruits into three groups: unripe,  ripe, and overripe. This classifier will have practical applications in various industries,  
including agriculture, food processing, and supply chain management. By accomplishing 
this objective, we hope to enhance quality control procedures, streamline resource 
allocation, and minimize food waste.


Overall, our project's objective is to develop a Fruit Maturity Identification System that 
not only meets the accuracy requirements but also addresses the practical needs and 
challenges faced by the fruit industry. Through this innovative solution, we aim to 
contribute to improved fruit quality assessment, resource optimization, and enhanced 
efficiency in the industry's supply chain
